I'm Florian Priv√©, a PhD student in predictive human genetics in Grenoble, France.

I'm attending remotely, so my typical day with you will be 6pm-2am.

I've recently submitted a paper about [two R packages for efficient management and analysis of large-scale genome-wide data](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/19/190926). 

Basically, I love R(cpp) and I want to do all my analysis workflow within R.
