## DATA

- use of 1000G from Gad

## ANALYSIS

- download files
- unzip files
- use of sofware from system calls (PLINK / EIGENSOFT)
- read/write files (show that fread/fwrite are much faster)
- use glue 

## WHY?

- conversions / data formats
- use notebooks to have fully reproducible pipeline
- visualize and report results in R anyway
