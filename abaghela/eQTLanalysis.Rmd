This is the start of an simplified eQTL analysis. The goal is to highlight different packages which can make this easier and the general overview how it is done.


First things first, lets load the packages we will primarily use. 
```{r}
library(biomaRt)
library(data.table)
library(magrittr) # This is to be able to use the pipe. 
```

Next thing we want to upload our expression data, in the form of a count table. This means that the RNA-seq data has already been aligned and counted. 
```{r}
read.csv("./")
```
