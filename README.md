This repository features a collection of advanced R tutorials for genomic data analysis. Check them out here: 

**R Tutorials:** [https://hackseq.github.io/2017_project_5/](https://hackseq.github.io/2017_project_5/)

This idea is born out of the realization that much of the more advanced domain-specific knowledge needed for genomic data analysis is acquired through serendipitous discovery and extensive experience. The aim of this project is to pool this hard-fought collective knowledge and organize it into consistent modular tutorials.
