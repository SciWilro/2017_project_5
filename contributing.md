# How can you contribute?

1. You can create a new GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/hackseq/2017_project_5/issues/new). 
2. Include the details below in your issue. 

## What you should include?

- What topic (_e.g._ R package) will you showcase?
- Why do you think it's worthwhile learning about this topic/package?
    - It's important to state the motivation so it's clear to readers why they should read further.
- What dataset will you use?
    - Preferably, pick a dataset that is relatively small. 
    - If the dataset is large, you can subset it to make it smaller (_e.g._ subset on chromosomes 20-22). 
    - Try to leverage datasets that are used elsewhere in this set of tutorials. 
    - It would be nice if there was a permalink for downloading the dataset. If a custom dataset is created (_e.g._ subsetting an existing large dataset), it would be great if the custom version was hosted somewhere (_e.g._ FigShare) so you can provide a permalink. 
- What software dependencies need to be installed? 
    - R packages are usually easy to install, so it's okay to install a few R packages. 
    - Other command-line tools might be harder to set up on certain systems (_e.g._ Windows), so try to limit the number of external tool dependencies. 
- What will you cover in your tutorial? 
    - This roughly corresponds to an outline of what you will accomplish in your tutorial using the dataset you picked.
