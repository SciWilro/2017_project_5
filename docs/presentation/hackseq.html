# How documented are your tools?

**Different levels of documentation**
    
1. No documentation at all
    * Lame...
    
2. Function documentation (inputs and outputs)
    * The bare minimum
    * Required for CRAN submission
    
3. Vignettes (example use cases)
    * The most useful! 
    * Required for Bioconductor submission

# Our project goal 

## To organize our hard-fought collective knowledge into modular tutorials that use a common dataset

---

# Our tutorials

* Pipelines
    * Doing all your analysis in R

* Data Wrangling and Analysis
    * Simplified eQTL analysis in R [WIP]
    * Analysis results in a consistent data structure
    * Genomic data analysis with large matrices in R

* Data Vizualization
    * Unsupervised clustering

* Reporting
    * Authentic code in wet lab, bridging dry and wet partners [WIP]
    * Integration of genomic analytic results as a multi-tab Excel sheet with 'xlsx'

---

# Benefits of hackathon-driven tutorial development

* Motivating that everyone is working towards the same goal

* You can cover more ground as a group

* Immediate peer review of your tutorials

* You can tap into the group's collective knowledge
    * Different perspectives
    * Tutorials can be the distillate of this collective knowledge
    * Faster problem-solving

# Challenges of hackathon-driven tutorial development

* Picking a focus
    * Which audience do you want to target?
    * Do you want to create introductory or more advanced tutorials?
    * Which topics aren't already covered online?

* Picking a common dataset
    * Openly accessible
    * Relatively tidy
    * Interesting and relevant to target audience
    * Multi-dimensional
    * Not too small nor too big

---

# Virtual participation

* Increasing the accessibility of your events

* Hackathons are particularly amenable to remote participation
    * Git and GitHub for code collaboration and task management
    * Slack for instant messaging

* Especially simple with tutorials
    * They can be developed independently from others on the team
    * While working towards the same goal
    * While benefitting from the collective knowledge

* Some drawbacks
    * No participation in the socials
    * Indirect networking 
    * Constant and clear communication is key!
