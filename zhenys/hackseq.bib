  abstract    = "The heart develops from a simple left-right (L-R) symmetrical
                 tube. Through a complex process of looping and remodelling, it
                 becomes a highly L-R asymmetrical organ with distinct
                 asymmetries in both morphology and function. Abnormal cardiac
                 L-R patterning can result in a spectrum of defects that
                 include, dextrocardia (a malposition of the heart to the
                 right), isomerism of the atria (both atria being
                 morphologically right-sided or left-sided), abnormal
                 ventricular topology (e.g. the morphological left ventricle
                 being dextral to the morphological right ventricle) or
                 mirror-image topology (associated with situs inversus).
                 Intermediate forms include abnormalities such as situs
                 ambiguus and heterotaxia. L-R patterning abnormalities are
                 typically associated with cardiac malformations, and it has
                 become clear that an isolated septal, outflow tract and aortic
                 arch malformation may be the only presenting manifestation of
                 an L-R patterning defect. In the last two decades, there have
                 been seminal advances in our understanding of the mechanisms
                 controlling L-R patterning, and how mutations in L-R
                 patterning genes result in human cardiac malformation. In this
                 review, we provide an overview of the transcriptional
                 mechanisms that result in asymmetric gene activation in
                 mammals, how they receive information from signalling
                 pathways, and how this translates to abnormal cardiac

               Quantitative issues contributing to reproducibility challenges
               have been considered (including improper data measurement and
               analysis, inadequate statistical expertise, and incomplete data,
               among others), but there is no clear consensus on how best to
               approach or to minimize these problems. A lack of
               reproducibility of scientific results has created some distrust
               in scientific findings among the general public, scientists,
               funding agencies, and industries. While studies fail for a
               variety of reasons, many factors contribute to the lack of
               perfect reproducibility, including insufficient training in
               experimental design, misaligned incentives for publication and
               the implications for university tenure, intentional
               manipulation, poor data management and analysis, and inadequate
               instances of statistical inference. The workshop summarized in
               this report was designed not to address the social and
               experimental challenges but instead to focus on the latter
               issues of improper data management and analysis, inadequate
               statistical expertise, incomplete data, and difficulties
               applying sound statistic inference to the available data. Many
               efforts have emerged over recent years to draw attention to and
               improve reproducibility of scientific work. This report uniquely
               focuses on the statistical perspective of three issues: the
               extent of reproducibility, the causes of reproducibility
               failures, and the potential remedies for these failures.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Cardiac maturation during perinatal transition of
                 heart is critical for functional adaptation to hemodynamic
                 load and nutrient environment. Perturbation in this process
                 has major implications in congenital heart defects.
                 Transcriptome programming during perinatal stages is an
                 important information but incomplete in current literature,
                 particularly, the expression profiles of the long noncoding
                 RNAs (lncRNAs) are not fully elucidated. METHODS AND RESULTS:
                 From comprehensive analysis of transcriptomes derived from
                 neonatal mouse heart left and right ventricles, a total of 45
                 167 unique transcripts were identified, including 21 916 known
                 and 2033 novel lncRNAs. Among these lncRNAs, 196 exhibited
                 significant dynamic regulation along maturation process. By
                 implementing parallel weighted gene co-expression network
                 analysis of mRNA and lncRNA data sets, several lncRNA modules
                 coordinately expressed in a developmental manner similar to
                 protein coding genes, while few lncRNAs revealed
                 chamber-specific patterns. Out of 2262 lncRNAs located within
                 50 kb of protein coding genes, 5\% significantly correlate
                 with the expression of their neighboring genes. The impact of
                 Ppp1r1b-lncRNA on the corresponding partner gene Tcap was
                 validated in cultured myoblasts. This concordant regulation
                 was also conserved in human infantile hearts. Furthermore, the
                 Ppp1r1b-lncRNA/Tcap expression ratio was identified as a
                 molecular signature that differentiated congenital heart
                 defect phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides the first
                 high-resolution landscape on neonatal cardiac lncRNAs and
                 reveals their potential interaction with mRNA transcriptome
                 during cardiac maturation. Ppp1r1b-lncRNA was identified as a
                 regulator of Tcap expression, with dynamic interaction in
                 postnatal cardiac development and congenital heart defects",

               attacking many types of R programming problems, helping you
               avoid mistakes and dead ends. With more than ten years of
               experience programming in R, the author illustrates the
               elegance, beauty, and flexibility at the heart of R. The book
               develops the necessary skills to produce quality code that can
               be used in a variety of circumstances. You will learn: The
               fundamentals of R, including standard data types and functions
               Functional programming as a useful framework for solving wide
               classes of problems The positives and negatives of
               metaprogramming How to write fast, memory-efficient code This
               book not only helps current R users become R programmers but
               also shows existing programmers what’s special about R.
               Intermediate R programmers can dive deeper into R and learn new
               strategies for solving diverse problems while programmers from
               other languages can learn the details of R and understand why R
